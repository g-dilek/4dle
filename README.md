# 4dle  
### A text-based, 4-letter version of Wordle

Welcome to **4dle**, a minimalist, text-based Wordle clone that challenges you to guess a random 4-letter word using only your keyboard and the browser console. Unlike regular Wordle, plays are not limited to once per day-- play again and again for new words every time!

## How to Play

- Type a 4-letter word into the console and press **Enter**.
- You'll get feedback for each letter:
  - `letter` = correct letter, correct position
  - `*` = correct letter, wrong position
  - `_` = letter not in the word
- Keep guessing until you crack the code!
